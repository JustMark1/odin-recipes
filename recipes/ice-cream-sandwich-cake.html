    <h2>The Recipe:</h2>
    <p>This ice cream sandwich cake was renamed as "The Best Dessert I've Ever Eaten" by my daughter this Memorial Day.</p>
    <p>I had made it before, but my husband ate all of it before she had a chance to get a taste! 
        <br />My husband doesn't like when I take this desert to a large gathering because it means he won't have any leftovers!</p>
